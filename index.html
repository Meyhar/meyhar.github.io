									<h2>Research Experience</h2>
								</header>
								<p>Here are some of the key research projects I've been a part of.</p>
								<section>
									<h3>GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research, Germany</h3>
									<p>
										<b>Project: Simulation Studies on the UniCell Setup</b> (Summer 2025)  <br>
										<i>Advisor: Dr. Jochen C. Ballof </i> <br>
										I ran SIMION simulation studies on the UniCell, a novel gas stopping cell designed to reduce the extraction time of superheavy elements. When the ion funnel had shorted electrode plates, I developed and validated a method through simulation to restore high efficiency without requiring mechanical repair to the funnel.
									</p>
									<h3>Karmanos Cancer Center, Wayne State University</h3>
									<p>
										<b>Project: Compton Camera for Medical Physics Applications</b> (Oct 2024 - Feb 2025)  <br>
										<i>Advisor: Dr. Ramesh Boggula </i> <br>
										I researched the application of Compton cameras for imaging gamma rays from patients administered nuclear medicine like Pluvicto (Lu-177). My work and findings directly led to the cancer center acquiring a Compton camera from M3D imaging.
									</p>
									<h3>Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB), MSU</h3>
									<p>
										<b>Projects: EDM³ and Single Atom Microscope (SAM)</b> (Oct 2022 - Dec 2024)<br>
										<i>PI: Dr. Jaideep T Singh </i> <br>
										As a student research assistant, I assembled an ion transport instrument using vacuum chambers and ion funnels for the EDM³ project, learning vacuum operation skills. I also built low-noise electrical breakout boxes, reducing noise in pico-amp current measurements. For the SAM project, I constructed a blackout enclosure which reduced optical background photon counts and performed theoretical calculations and analysis using Zemax OpticStudio and Python.
									</p>
									<h3>Lyman Briggs College, MSU</h3>
									<p>
										<b>Project: Diophantine Triples</b> (Sept 2022 - Present) <br>
										<i>Advisor: Dr. Aklilu Zeleke </i> <br>
										Under the guidance of Prof. Zeleke, I am conducting number theory research. I created a Python program to generate and filter arrays that fit the conditions of a Diophantine triple, found multiple recurrence relations, and am now in the process of publishing a paper on our findings.

								<h4>Global Travel & Cultural Exploration</h4>
<p>A dedicated traveler, I have a deep passion for exploring new cultures and landscapes. In the last three years, my journeys have taken me to 9 countries and 39 U.S. states, providing me with a broad perspective on the world.</p>

<h5>North America: The United States & Canada</h5>
<p>My travels across the United States have been extensive, defined largely by cross-country road trips. These journeys have spanned from the West Coast to the East Coast, allowing for an in-depth appreciation of the country's diverse geography and culture.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Natural Wonders:</strong> I have a particular affinity for the natural beauty of the National Parks system. The striking landscapes of Crater Lake National Park in Oregon, the Grand Canyon in Arizona, and the scenic drives through Utah have been exceptionally memorable.</li>
    <li><strong>Urban Centers:</strong> I have also explored major metropolitan areas, with New York City, Washington D.C., Seattle, and Chicago being personal favorites.</li>
    <li><strong>Michigan:</strong> Having resided in Michigan for over three years, I've come to appreciate its unique beauty, from its state and national parks to its famously unpredictable weather.</li>
    <li><strong>Canada:</strong> My initial travels in Canada include visits to Toronto and Windsor, where I've enjoyed the authentic cuisine, including renowned poutine and Indian food, and observed the quality of its infrastructure.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Asia: Heritage and New Horizons</h5>
<ul>
    <li><strong>India:</strong> As my country of origin, India holds a special significance. I visit annually to connect with family and continue exploring my heritage. My travels have included major cities like Mumbai (a personal favorite), Bangalore, Delhi, and Amritsar.</li>
    <li><strong>Southeast Asia:</strong> My explorations in this region include a family trip to Thailand (Bangkok and Pattaya) focused on cultural immersion, and a solo journey to Vietnam (Ho Chi Minh City) to delve into its rich history and cuisine.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Europe: Academic and Cultural Immersion</h5>
<p>My European travels were centered around a summer school program at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Germany:</strong> This opportunity was an invaluable blend of academic enrichment and cultural immersion, where I learned about large-scale experimental physics and built connections with peers from across the globe. My travels included Frankfurt, Freiburg, and Baden-Baden.</li>
    <li><strong>France & Switzerland:</strong> During this time, I also took the opportunity to visit neighboring countries. This included a trip to Strasbourg, France, to observe the unique blend of French and German cultures, and a visit to Basel, Switzerland, which offered insights into its high quality of life and stunning beauty.</li>
    <li><strong>United Kingdom:</strong> A brief, day-long visit to London allowed for a tour of iconic landmarks such as Big Ben, Hyde Park, and Oxford Street.</li>
</ul>
