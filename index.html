									<h2>Research Experience</h2>
								</header>
								<p>Here are some of the key research projects I've been a part of.</p>
								<section>
									<h3>GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research, Germany</h3>
									<p>
										<b>Project: Simulation Studies on the UniCell Setup</b> (Summer 2025)  <br>
										<i>Advisor: Dr. Jochen C. Ballof </i> <br>
										I ran SIMION simulation studies on the UniCell, a novel gas stopping cell designed to reduce the extraction time of superheavy elements. When the ion funnel had shorted electrode plates, I developed and validated a method through simulation to restore high efficiency without requiring mechanical repair to the funnel.
									</p>
									<h3>Karmanos Cancer Center, Wayne State University</h3>
									<p>
										<b>Project: Compton Camera for Medical Physics Applications</b> (Oct 2024 - Feb 2025)  <br>
										<i>Advisor: Dr. Ramesh Boggula </i> <br>
										I researched the application of Compton cameras for imaging gamma rays from patients administered nuclear medicine like Pluvicto (Lu-177). My work and findings directly led to the cancer center acquiring a Compton camera from M3D imaging.
									</p>
									<h3>Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB), MSU</h3>
									<p>
										<b>Projects: EDM³ and Single Atom Microscope (SAM)</b> (Oct 2022 - Dec 2024)<br>
										<i>PI: Dr. Jaideep T Singh </i> <br>
										As a student research assistant, I assembled an ion transport instrument using vacuum chambers and ion funnels for the EDM³ project, learning vacuum operation skills. I also built low-noise electrical breakout boxes, reducing noise in pico-amp current measurements. For the SAM project, I constructed a blackout enclosure which reduced optical background photon counts and performed theoretical calculations and analysis using Zemax OpticStudio and Python.
									</p>
									<h3>Lyman Briggs College, MSU</h3>
									<p>
										<b>Project: Diophantine Triples</b> (Sept 2022 - Present) <br>
										<i>Advisor: Dr. Aklilu Zeleke </i> <br>
										Under the guidance of Prof. Zeleke, I am conducting number theory research. I created a Python program to generate and filter arrays that fit the conditions of a Diophantine triple, found multiple recurrence relations, and am now in the process of publishing a paper on our findings.

								<h2>Travel Blog</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								I have a passion for travel. In the last 3 years, I have been to 39 US states and 9 different countries. 
								<ul>

									<li>United States of America</li> 
										<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
											<li>In the US, my travel has been primarily road trips. Especially with one of my best friends from California to Michigan. I have gone to east coast multiple times to visit friends and see NYC, Washington and Boston.</li>
											<li>My favourite places are the national parks in the US. Especially, crater lake national park in Oregon and Grand Canyon in Arizona. However, the most scenic beauty that I have witnessed by driving was in Utah.</li>
											<li>I love Michigan as I have lived here for more than 3 years now. It is a beautiful state with great state and national parks. I like to claim that if someone says they can predict michigan weather with 100% accuracy, then either they are lying or they are a god. Michigan weather is one of the most unpredictable things ever. I have witnessed snow, hail, rain and sunny on the same day here. It is kinda fun because you don't know what weather you'll be faced with.</li>
											<li>My favourite cities in the US include NYC, Washington, Seattle and Chicago.</li>
										</ul>
								 
									<li>Canada</li>
									<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
										<li>I am yet to travel extensively in Canada. Till now I have only been to Toronto and Windsor. I must say that it is cheaper in Canada than states.</li>
										<li>Food in Canada is suprisingly good. I love their poutine fries. Also, the Indian food in Canada is quite authentic.</li>
										<li>Ontario roads are way smoother than Michigan. Sorry MI, gotta be honest.</li>
									</ul>
									<li>India</li>
									<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
										<li> Since, I am an Indian. You would expect me to have travelled India extensively. However, my travels in India have not been as extensive as the US because I was a kid for the most part when I lived in India.</li>
										<li>Allmost all of my family lives in India, so I try to visit at least once a year.</li>
										<li>The food in India is great, though you must be careful if you are trying the street food cause some of that can be injurious to health.</li>
										<li>I have visited some places in India like Mumbai, Bangalore, Tirupati, Amritsar, Lucknow, Kanpur and Delhi.</li>
										<li>I think my favourite city would be Mumbai.</li>
									</ul>
									<li>Thailand</li>
									<ul style="list-style-type: square;"> 
										<li>This was a family trip to Bangkok and Pattaya for exploring Thai culture and also to visit a friend of my dad's. </li>
										<li>I think it is a very interesting place with a great culture. </li>
									</ul>
									<li>Vietnam</li>
									<ul style="list-style-type: square;"> 
										<li>This was my solo trip to explore the history of Vietnam and explore the vietnamese cuisine. </li>
										<li>I went to Saigon and stayed downtown. One thing that surprised me was the good Indian food in Saigon.</li>
									</ul>
									<li>United Kingdom</li>
									<ul style="list-style-type: square;"> 
										<li>I was in London only for a day. I saw some landmarks like the Big Ben, Hyde park, and Oxford Street.  </li>
									</ul>
									<li>Germany</li>
									<ul style="list-style-type: square;"> 
										<li>I went to Germany to attend a Summer School at GSI, Darmstadt.</li>
										<li>This was a great learning and fun experience. I learnt a lot about large scale experiments.</li>
										<li>Also, made great friends and had a lot of fun with them. Especially the Greeks, the Poles and the Italians.</li>
										<li>Learnt a lot about European culture and laws.</li>
										<li>Had lots of Falafel that I definitely miss back here in the US.</li>
										<li>I visited Frankfurt, Darmstadt, Freiburg(interesting small water canals that people dip their feet in??) and Baden Baden.</li>
									</ul>
									<li>France</li>
									<ul style="list-style-type: square;"> 
										<li>Went to Strasbourg, what a fantastic place</li>
										<li>You could see the differences and the influence of German culture on the French one.</li>
										<li>Roughly half of the Summer students went on this trip and we had a lot of fun. We tried to visit the EU parliament but we were 2 minutes late.</li>
									</ul>
									<li>Switzerland</li>
									<ul style="list-style-type: square;"> 
										<li>This is perhaps the most expensive place I have ever visited.</li>
										<li>We went to Basel and for lunch had pizza for $25.</li>
										<li>Everything in Switzerland, from chocolates to food to travel is expensive. I have been told that Swiss people are well paid so to them it is normal but for anyone visiting from outside it is crazy expensive.</li>
										<li>I must say though that it is very beautiful and an interesting place.</li>
									</ul>
